# ArchTimeSaver
A very small and fast Arch Linux (UEFI) installer.

I beleive the script is easily readable and very efficirnt. 
It install the base system and Gnome DE.

Partitioning is left to the user before running the script,
as partitioning is based on personal preference.

The scrip is oriented to dualbooting a second OS (Windows in this case).



Some code was borrowed from
