# ArchTimeSaver
A very small and fast Arch Linux (UEFI) installer.

I beleive the script is readable and very efficient. 
It install the base system and Gnome DE.

Partitioning is left to the user before running the script,
as partitioning is based on personal preference.

The scrip is oriented to dualbooting a second OS (Windows in this case).

To download this script to the Arch Installation USB the "$curl" command can be used:
#####$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S1lverCr0w/ArchTimeSaver/main/arch_install.sh > arch_installscript.sh
